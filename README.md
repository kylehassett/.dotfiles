# dotfiles

Dotfiles setup for Kyle Hassett

## About me

At the moment I work as a full stack web dev specializing in front end. Aka, I write react all day, and love doing it!

As you probably expect, I use vscode to develop, spotify to keep me entertained, and vim only when there's a gun to my head. Just kidding... <sub>unless ;-)</sub> So this will contain setup related to all that stuff.

I use a macbook pro personally and at work, but personally I will soon have to purchase a new one. My battery is dying, the CPU is long in the tooth, and the GPU can't really keep up with Blender

I wish to port all of my setup for my current machine such that I can hit the ground running with the new machine.

Also, I wanted to finally take the plunge into learning how to use vim/nvim only. I keep hearing that it's the best way to program, so it's better late than never.

I don't feel *hindered* by vscode at all, but everyone who switches to vim/nvim ends up swearing by it, so I want to learn it and see if it's all that for myself. Your results may vary.

## Usage

Pretty self explanatory
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/kylehassett/.dotfiles.git
cd .dotfiles
./bootstrap.sh
```

## Feedback

Not sure if anyone will care to do give any feedback since dotfiles are a dime a dozen, but feel free to leave any advice or feedback you have.
At the time of me typing this, this is prior to me ever learning how to write shell scripts, so anything that can will me will be appreciated.

### August 31st, 2022

Ok so a good amount has changed since I started doing this...

1. I took the time to learn Vim.<br />
    a. Starting with using the Vim extension for Vscode, which is my daily workflow now.<br />
2. I am now making the plunge into Neovim only for all development.<br />
    a. I'm realizing that I love using Vim for editing, and I need to remove the crutch of using Vscode because I use the mouse too much.<br />
    b. I recommend everyone start using Vim by using their favorite IDE's Vim extension, it was truly a gateway-drug-like experience.<br />
3. I have started a software project called [Gealio](https://geal.io)<br />
    a. Along with work itself, hobbies, loved ones, this will be my focus.<br />
