# dotfiles
My own dotfiles setup.

## About me
Dotfiles are a very personal thing, so here's a little bit about me before I start to explain the setup.

My name's Kyle Hassett, I work as full stack web dev specializing in front end. Aka, I write react all day (and love doing it)!

As you probably expect, I use vscode to develop, spotify to keep me entertained, and vim only when there's a gun to my head. Just kidding... <sub>unless ðŸ˜³</sub>

So this will contain setup related to all that stuff. I will soon have to purchase a new laptop, thanks to a dying battery, and wish to port all of my setup for my current machine such that I can hit the ground running with the new machine.

## Usage
Pretty self explanatory
```
git clone https://github.com/kylehassett/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./bootstrap.sh
```

## Feedback
Not sure if anyone will care to do give any feedback since dotfiles are a dime a dozen, but feel free to leave any advice or feedback you have.
At the time of me typing this, this is prior to me ever learning how to write shell scripts, so anything that can will me will be appreciated.
